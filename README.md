# Web-Scrapping-on-Just-Watch
Data analysis project
## Description
  In this web scraping project, I utilized Python's BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to extract information about movies and tv 
  show from the JustWatch website. 
  The process involved scraping details such as titles, release years, genres, IMDb ratings, age ratings, durations, production 
  countries, streaming service providers, and URLs for both Movies and Tv Shows. 
  I navigated through the HTML structure of the web pages, identifying key elements and their classes to locate the desired 
  information. 
  The code snippets include iterations through lists of movie and TV show URLs, finding specific HTML tags and classes, handling 
  different scenarios such as missing data, and storing the extracted information in Python lists.
  Subsequently, the data was organized into a Pandas DataFrame, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis. The final DataFrame 
  includes essential details about each movie and TV show, providing a comprehensive dataset for further exploration and insights.
